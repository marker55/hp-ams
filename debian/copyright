 ACCURACY OF INFORMATIONAL CONTENT, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ACCURACY

 ADVICE GIVEN BY HPE, HPE"S AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVES, OR ANY OTHER PARTY SHALL

 other rights that vary from country to country, state to state, or province to
 province.
 
	 b.	ACTIVATION KEY REQUIRED SOFTWARE - LIMITED WARRANTY.
 
 HPE warrants that the Product will perform substantially in accordance with the
 accompanying materials for a period of ninety (90) days from the date of
 purchase.  If an implied warranty or condition is created by Your

 it, You also have an implied warranty or condition, BUT ONLY AS TO DEFECTS FOR
 WHICH CLAIMS ARE MADE WITHIN NINETY (90) DAYS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE. AS TO
 ANY DEFECTS DISCOVERED FOR WHICH A CLAIM IS NOT MADE WITHIN THE NINETY-DAY
 PERIOD, THERE IS NO WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND.
 Some states/jurisdictions do not allow limitations on how long an implied
 warranty or condition lasts, so the above limitation may not apply to You.
 
	 DISCLAIMER.  The Limited Warranty that appears above is the only
 express warranty made to You and is provided in lieu of any other express
 warranties or implied warrantees (if any) created by any documentation,
 packaging or otherwise.  EXCEPT FOR THE LIMITED WARRANTY, AND TO THE MAXIMUM
 EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, HPE AND ITS SUPPLIERS PROVIDE THE PRODUCT
 AND SUPPORT SERVICES (IF ANY) "AS IS" AND WITH ALL FAULTS, AND HEREBY DISCLAIM
 ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY,
 INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY (IF ANY) IMPLIED WARRANTIES, DUTIES OR
 CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
 SATISFACTORY QUALITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF TITLE, OF ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS

 LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH USE.   YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO YOUR

 (including, without limitation, all damages referenced above and all direct
